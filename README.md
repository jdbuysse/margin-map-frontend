## Purpose
*Margin Map* addresses a real problem that I noticed in writing pedagogy in my time teaching writing and English courses, which is connecting individual lessons with the larger themes and emphasis of the class. This repo sketches out the frontend for a larger platform currently under development, and allows teachers to publish lessons and solicit comments from students.
## Video Demo

## Technologies
* React (mostly hooks)
* Javascript
* Bootstrap 4
* Node.js/Express
* MongoDB
* This sweet component (https://github.com/bvaughn/react-highlight-words)

## Features
- Highlight text to add an annotation
- View all annotations at a glance with a mouseover effect, or click on individual highlights to take a closer look
- See lessons, classes, and students

## Under Development
- The backend is currently being overhauled to more effectively model relationships between teachers, classes, and students.
- I'm working on implementing new tools for live feedback from students (ie a teacher posts a multiple choice question and gets real-time input from the class)
- Deployment soon!
